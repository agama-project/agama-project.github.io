# Official Agama Live ISO

Agama **is a multi-product installer**. It means that you can install different distributions using
a single medium. In close collaboration with the openSUSE project, the current image allows
installing [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://www.opensuse.org/#Tumbleweed), [openSUSE Leap 16.0
](https://www.opensuse.org/#Leap), [openSUSE Micro OS](https://get.opensuse.org/microos/) and
[openSUSE Slowroll](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Slowroll) (experimental).

## Download the Agama Live ISO

Download the ISO image that matches the architecture of your machine. The `*.sha256` files contain a
checksum of the ISO file so you can verify that the image was downloaded correctly, see the
instructions below.

### Verifying the downloaded image

You might want to check whether the ISO was correctly downloaded. If that's the case, you can
download the checksum file too and use the
[sha256sum](https://manpages.opensuse.org/Tumbleweed/coreutils-doc/sha256sum.1.en.html) command:

```shell
sha256sum -c agama-installer.x86_64-openSUSE.iso.sha256
```

Obviously, use the checksum that corresponds to the downloaded ISO.

## Create a bootable medium

Once you have the ISO, it is time to create a bootable USB stick (recommended) or burn a DVD. Follow
the documentation for your operating system below.

## Start the installation

Starting the system using the bootable medium should take you to the product selection screen.
Please, bear in mind that it may take a few seconds. You might want to review the [starter's
guide](docs/overview) to know how to continue from here.
