# Configuration profiles

Agama is able to install a system without user interaction. The general process is described
at the [corresponding section](../overview/unattended) of the starter's guide and is based on the
concept of configuration profiles.

Profiles are also useful to setup advanced Agama [configurations using the command-line
interface](../overview/cli).

This section of the documentation provides more information about those Agama profiles and about
Agama's compatibility with AutoYaST profiles.
