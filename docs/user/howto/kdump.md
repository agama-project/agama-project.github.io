You're looking for a technical guide on enabling kdump with recommended values immediately after the first boot on SLES, specifically in the context of an Agama unattended installation. The provided snippet is a good starting point. Let's create that guide.

## How to Enable Kdump with Recommended Values Immediately After First Boot on SLES

This guide outlines the steps to automatically enable and configure kdump on a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) system as part of an unattended installation using Agama. This ensures that kdump is active and ready to capture kernel crash dumps immediately after the first boot, providing crucial diagnostic information in case of system failures.

**Prerequisites:**

  * A SLES installation environment.
  * Familiarity with Agama.
  * Basic understanding of shell scripting.

**Understanding the Agama Snippet:**

The provided Agama configuration snippet uses a `post` script to execute commands within the chrooted environment of the installed system. This is the ideal place to configure kdump.

```jsonnet
{
  product: {
    id: 'SLES',
    registrationCode: 'INTERNAL-USE-ONLY-28ab-5d40', // Replace with your actual registration code
  },
  user: {
    fullName: 'Monsignore Tux',
    password: 'linux',
    userName: 'tux',
  },
  scripts: {
    post: [
      {
        name: 'enable-kdump',
        chroot: true,
        content: |||
          #!/usr/bin/bash
          zypper -n in kdump
          systemctl enable kdump-commandline.service
          systemctl enable kdump.service
          kdumptool commandline -u
        |||,
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

### 1\. Integrate the Kdump Configuration into Your Agama Installation

You will incorporate the `scripts` section into your main Agama configuration file.

**For a Full Unattended Installation:**

If you are performing a fully unattended installation, simply merge the `scripts` section from the provided snippet into your existing Agama configuration JSON.

**Example (simple Agama config written in pure json):**

```json
{
  "product": {
    "id": "SLES",
    "registrationCode": "YOUR-SLES-REGISTRATION-CODE"
  },
  "user": {
    "fullName": "Your Name",
    "password": "your_password",
    "userName": "your_username"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "post": [
      {
        "name": "enable-kdump",
        "chroot": true,
        "content": "#!/usr/bin/bash\nzypper -n in kdump\nsystemctl enable kdump-commandline.service\nsystemctl enable kdump.service\nkdumptool commandline -u"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**For Interactive Agama with CLI Snippet Loading:**

If you are using Agama interactively and want to enable kdump. Then switch to terminal and save the `scripts` section into a separate file (e.g., `kdump_config.jsonnet` or `kdump_config.json` if you prefer pure JSON).

**`kdump_config.jsonnet` (using `|||` for multiline string):**

```jsonnet
{
  scripts: {
    post: [
      {
        name: 'enable-kdump',
        chroot: true,
        content: |||
          #!/usr/bin/bash
          zypper -n in kdump
          systemctl enable kdump-commandline.service
          systemctl enable kdump.service
          kdumptool commandline -u
        |||,
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

**Then, during your interactive Agama session, you would load this configuration:**

```bash
agama config load < kdump_config.jsonnet
```

### 2\. Explanation of the `post` Script Commands:

Let's break down the commands within the `content` of the `post` script:

  * `#!/usr/bin/bash`: Shebang line, ensuring the script is executed with bash.
  * `zypper -n in kdump`: This command uses `zypper` (SUSE's package manager) to install the `kdump` package. The `-n` flag stands for "non-interactive" and assumes "yes" to any prompts, which is essential for unattended installations.
  * `systemctl enable kdump-commandline.service`: This enables the `kdump-commandline.service`. This service is crucial for setting up kdump parameters from the kernel command line during boot.
  * `systemctl enable kdump.service`: This enables the main `kdump.service`. This service manages the kdump daemon, which is responsible for capturing and saving crash dumps.
  * `kdumptool commandline -u`: This is a critical command. `kdumptool` is a utility for configuring kdump.
      * `commandline`: This option tells `kdumptool` to operate on bootloader kernel command line.
      * `-u` (or `--update`): This option instructs `kdumptool` to update the bootloader
      * configuration with recommended values.

### 3\. Verification After Installation:

After the SLES installation is complete and the system has rebooted for the first time, you can verify that kdump is enabled and configured correctly:

1.  **Check Kdump Service Status:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status kdump
    sudo systemctl status kdump-commandline.service
    ```

    Both services should be `active (exited)` or `active (running)`.

2.  **Verify Kdump Kernel Parameter:**
    Check the kernel command line to ensure `crashkernel=` allocation is present.

    ```bash
    cat /proc/cmdline
    ```

    You should see an entry like `crashkernel=<size>M@<offset>`.

3.  **Test Kdump (Optional, on a non-production system):**
    To confirm kdump functionality, you can intentionally trigger a kernel crash. **Do not do this on a production system.**

    ```bash
    echo c | sudo tee /proc/sysrq-trigger
    ```

    After the system reboots, check the `/var/crash` directory for a new crash dump.

By following these steps, you can ensure that kdump is automatically enabled and configured with recommended values immediately after the first boot of your SLES system, providing valuable capabilities for diagnosing system stability issues.
