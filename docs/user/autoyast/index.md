# AutoYaST support

We know that many AutoYaST users have invested quite some time in writing their profiles to perform
unattended installations. For that reason, Agama offers a mechanism to reuse such profiles to some extent.

However, Agama and AutoYaST have different features. Unlike AutoYaST, Agama is focused on the
installation and delegates further configuration to other tools. From this point of view, it is
clear that many of the sections in an AutoYaST profile will not have an Agama counterpart.

This document describes how AutoYaST supports work, including the limitations you might find.

:::warning
AutoYaST support is not fully defined yet, which means that we might add support for more sections
in the future even if we do not plan to do so now. However, we will do our best to keep this
document up to date.

Please, let us know if you miss support for any section.
