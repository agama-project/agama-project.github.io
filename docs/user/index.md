# User documentation

Agama is a generic Linux installer, although at this point is only able to install SUSE and
openSUSE-based distributions. In close collaboration with the openSUSE community, we maintain the
[openSUSE Live ISO](/download), which uses Agama to install several openSUSE distributions.

This section of the documentation explains how to use Agama to install a system using the mentioned
Agama Live ISO image, although the information should be useful for any Live ISO that makes use of
Agama.

:::warning Work in progress
