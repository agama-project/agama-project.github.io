# Introduction

This section contains general information about several relatively advanced aspects of Agama. It
targets users who want to use Agama to install one or several Linux systems and that already know
Agama basic concepts. If needed, check first the [starter's guide](/docs/overview) to learn the
basis about how to use Agama to install a system.

On the other hand, the [development section](/docs/devel) contains information for those
interested in the internal technical details needed to debug, configure or modify Agama.

:::warning Work in progress
The documentation is still a work in progress. Please, do not hesitate to give us feedback if you
find something is missing or unclear. Actually, you can even open a pull request if you want to.
