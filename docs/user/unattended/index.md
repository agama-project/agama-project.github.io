# Unattended installation

Agama is able to install a system without user interaction. The general process is described
at the [corresponding section](../overview/unattended) of the starter's guide and is based on the
concept of configuration profiles.

This section of the documentation provides more information about those Agama profiles and about
Agama's compatibility with AutoYaST profiles.
