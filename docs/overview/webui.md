# Interactive installation process

Assuming that you are already connected to the system you want to install, let's go briefly through
the installation workflow.

## Product selection {#product}

Agama allows installing several SUSE and openSUSE-based distributions. The [openSUSE-based
image](/download) image includes [Tumbleweed](https://www.opensuse.org/#Tumbleweed),
[Leap 16.0 Beta](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/16.0/), [Leap Micro 6.2 Beta](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Leap_Micro), [Slowroll](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Slowroll), [Kalpa](https://kalpadesktop.org/) and [openSUSE Micro
OS](https://get.opensuse.org/microos/).

It is noteworthy to mention that the product selection does not only determine which software we
will install, but it may affect other aspects like the system's partitioning.

![Product selection screen offering openSUSE Leap, MicroOS and
Tumbleweed](/img/user/product-selection.png)

You can change the product later if you change your mind, but you should carefully check the
configuration as some values can be reset.

## General layout {#layout}

Once you select a product, Agama takes you to the _overview page_. In the main area, you can find a
summary of the installation settings including localization, storage and software.

![Overview of the installation settings](/img/user/overview.png)

No matter whether you are at that initial **Overview** page or any other section of the installer,
the `Install` button is always present and allows to, unsurprisingly, start the installation. Check
the [Starting the installation](#installing) section for further information.

In the image above, the `Install` button cannot actually start the process because Agama is asking
to setup some authentication method first. In some cases, other issues may also be reported. Maybe
related to network access, to the partitioning of the hard disks or to the registration of certain
products. We will go back to that, but before doing so it is worth to pay attention to the rest of
the page layout.

The **sidebar** at the left contains a set of links to navigate to different installer areas (e.g.,
**Localization**, **Network**, **Storage**, etc.). You can follow those links to revisit and/or
change the installation settings for those areas. This **sidebar** can be shown or hidden by
clicking the icon at the top (the one with the three bars). It is important to know that, depending
on the form factor of your device, this _sidebar_ could be automatically hidden.

Finally, at the top right corner and next to the already mentioned `Install` button, there is
another button to change the localization settings for the installer and a menu offering some
special options, like the possibility of changing the chosen product as discussed above.

![Menu with special settings like changing product](/img/user/installer-menu.png)

Now we are ready to browse the different sections of the installer in no particular order, making
use of the freedom of movements provided by the Agama interface.

## Authentication {#authentication}

Most likely you need a mechanism to access the system once it is installed. And we already know
Agama forces us to setup some authentication before proceeding with the installation. So let's
start by inspecting that area. 

There Agama offers you to set up a `root` authentication method (a password or a public key) and/or
to create a dedicated user. As mentioned, it is mandatory to do any before starting the
installation.

![Users section including the root authentication and the dedicated user](/img/user/users.png)

Once authentication is set, it would be possible to just [start the installation](#installing)
unless Agama reports other issues. But even if no issues are reported, it is always a good idea to
take a look to the different areas of the Agama interface before proceeding.

## Network {#network}

Agama makes it easy to adjust your network configuration. It allows setting up wired and wireless
devices, specifying the mode (DHCP/manual), IP addresses, name servers, etc. Advanced
connections types, like bridges or bonds, does not have support in the user interface yet. However,
it is a matter of time that they get added, given that Agama supports many of them during an
[unattended installation](./unattended.md) or using the [command-line interface](./cli.md).

Beware that network configuration changes are applied instantly. So you must be careful when
adjusting the network configuration on a remote installation.

## Storage {#storage}

Setting up the different file systems and their corresponding logical devices -like partitions,
LVM volumes or RAIDs- is one of the most complex aspects of the installation.

The starting point at the Agama interface is pretty simple, you can choose the disk to install into
and decide what to do in order to find space for the new system in that disk, like deleting or
shrinking the current partitions.

![Overview of the storage configuration page](/img/user/storage-overview.png)

But Agama's storage user interface offers many more options that are described on its own [separate
document](/docs/user/storage.md). Nevertheless, similar to the case of the **Network** area
described [above](#network), the full Agama potential (like creating software MD RAIDs) is currently
only accesible using the unattended installation or the command-line interface.

## Registration {#registration}

If a product must be registered (e.g., SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 16), then a **Registration**
section is offered. In that section, the product can be registered through the SUSE Customer Center
server or specifying a custom registration server ([RMT](https://documentation.suse.com/en-us/sles/15-SP7/html/SLES-all/rmt-overview.html) or SCC proxy).

![Product registration](/img/user/registration.png)

The product will be registered using the hostname configured in the **Hostname** section. Note that
the hostname cannot be changed after registering the product.

## Localization {#localization}

This section allows to select the language, keyboard layout and timezone that the system you are
installing will use. Just click on the corresponding **Change** button to change any of them.

![Language, keyboard layout and timezone options](/img/user/localization.png)

As there are dozens of possible values, Agama features an small search box to make it easier to find
the value you want to select.

## Software {#software}

Agama software selection is rather simple. Depending on the product, it offers a reduced set of
software pattern. The image below partially shows how the software selector looks like. As in other
places of the interfaces, Agama offers a search box. If you need any advanced package selection, we
suggest to do it once the system is installed.

![Software selection including a short list of software patterns](/img/user/software.png)

## Starting the installation {#installing}

As mentioned above, the `Install` button can be pressed at any time. If there are no issues
preventing the installation, Agama will ask for confirmation. Once you accept, the installation
starts.

![Confirmation after pressing the `Install` button](/img/user/install-button.png)

The interface will then show the progress, allowing to reboot into the new system at the end of the
installation.
