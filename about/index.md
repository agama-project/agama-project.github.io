# What is Agama?

Agama is a new Linux installer born in the core of the [YaST](https://yast.opensuse.org/) team. It
is designed to offer re-usability, integration with third party tools and the possibility to
build advanced user interfaces over it.

It offers an HTTP API to control and monitor the whole installation process and comes with two user
interfaces: a modern web front-end and a powerful command-line tool.

Agama can perform interactive and unattended installations, making it possible even to mix both
approaches with any combination of manual work and automation.

Agama reuses many of the principles and internal components of (Auto)YaST, ensuring it can handle
a similar number of architectures and technologies. It also offers a high level of backwards
compatibility with AutoYaST for unattended installations, being often able to act as a drop-in
replacement.
